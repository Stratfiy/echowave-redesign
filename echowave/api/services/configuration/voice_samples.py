"""Letting somebody hear a voice before they put it on their phone line.

A voice is the one thing on the picker nobody can evaluate by reading. Seven
Indian first names and a gender is a list, not a choice — and the vendor
publishes no per-voice description for bulbul:v2 to borrow, so there is nothing
honest to write beside them either. The sample *is* the information.

**Pre-generated, not synthesised on demand.** Somebody auditioning voices
clicks every one, twice, and then again after changing the language. Doing that
live would be fourteen TTS calls to answer a question whose answer never
changes, on the screen where a first-time customer is deciding whether to
continue.

**Served by convention, not by a lookup.** The key is derived from the voice id
and language, so the UI can build the URL itself and a missing sample is a
quiet 404 on an audio element rather than a broken page. Generating them is a
one-off script; nothing at runtime depends on it having been run.
